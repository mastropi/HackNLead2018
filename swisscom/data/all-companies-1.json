The short-term consequences can be felt at a personal level impacting directly on comfort and security. An uprooting, or a profound change of environment, is sometimes considered as necessary. Elderly people are particularly sensitive to the stability of their environment and a profound change is often experienced as a form of trauma.\n\nThe recent technological developments give them access to tools that allow them to maintain a benevolent and discrete presence, at a distance from their home, from their family or institutions.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nThe AutonomisHome Foundation seeks to reinforce the autonomy of elderly people struggling to maintain their quality of life and that through the counsel and/or the financing of technical solutions.\n\nOUR GOAL\n\nFirst of all, the AutonomisHome Foundation offers advice on the most pertinent technical solutions proposed for promoting the reinforcement of autonomy at home. The issues that elderly people faces such as handicap, pathologies, mobility, etc in relation to their home must be considered in order to find the best solution. The impact of these solutions in terms of change is evaluated regarding the reinforcement of autonomy and the expected improvement of both their comfort and their security. Moreover, the respect of their private life and privacy must be preserved through technological choices that are the least invasive.\n\nThe costs of this solution are evaluated and the AutonomisHome Foundation can, on request of an accredited organism, offer a partial or complete fund for this solution.\n\nThe Foundation delivers a label that certifies not only the accreditation, but also the guarantee that the setting up of the autonomy supporting system and, especially its integration in a program of home care, will be truly efficient. The funds will only be transferred to public, semi-public or private institutions that are accredited by the Foundation in Switzerland.\n", "short_description": "The AutonomisHome Foundation seeks to reinforce the autonomy of elderly people struggling to maintain their quality of life.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "2015-04-01", "num_employees_max": 10, "rank": 539458}, {"name": "WeAVR", "num_employees_min": 1, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/weavr", "description": "WEAVR develops platforms to create and share stories in Virtual and Augmented Reality.", "short_description": "WEAVR Designs and develops VR Platforms.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "2017-01-01", "num_employees_max": 10, "rank": 230982}, {"name": "Kapaw", "num_employees_min": 1, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/kapaw", "description": "Kapaw was launched in 2016 to become a leading media company for a mobile first generation.\n\nKapaw explores passion points in Tech, Business, Politics, Environment, and Youth Culture.

A century after the first prosthesis, electrodes, electronics and surgical expertise can be merged into the life-changing solution.\n\nOur venture is a synergistic effort converging expertise from microtechnologies, algorithms, electronics and clinical experimentation.

We are constructing the game-changing functional improvement of the technology that will become the essential feature of the next-generation of prosthesis.\n\nAmputees and peripheral nerve damaged persons are in constant increase, mainly due to diabetes, car accidents, work injuries and wars. Among the most disabling consequences of these is the interruption of sensations flow from extremities to the brain.  The absence of feedback and the perception of prosthesis as a foreign body are the primary reason for refusal to use prosthesis. Amputees cannot feel the shape or material of objects they are holding and have no perception of the force required to hold or pick up objects. Nerve-injured persons often have completely functionally unusable limbs.

Therefore, in collaboration with engineers from Warsaw University of Technology, the software was brought into industrial-grade quality, and distributed to numerous leading PET sites in the world. Based on their feedback, scope and functionality were improved, resulting in a suite of tools covering the diverse needs of researchers in the field of molecular imaging.\n\nDue to the wide adaptation of PMOD in the field, support of the project within the University became difficult. Therefore, PMOD Technologies LLC was founded in 2003 as a spin-off of the Zurich PET Center to further develop and distribute the PMOD software.

That\u2019s how companies can significantly reduce overhead as well the lead time for projects from weeks to just a couple of hours.\r\nCompanies are also able to gain greater insight into their own internal workforce. Allowing them to quickly reallocate employees during re-organizations, re-engage talent through smart matched projects and as a result increase employee retention.\r\nF ECTIVE also provides the opportunity for consulting companies to offer their services through a digital channel, giving them direct access to companies, broadening their client network as well as utilizing independent contractors to support their own projects. \r\nWith a major shift away from single job careers, F ECTIVE understands that flexibility, opportunity and engagement is the new currency in today\u2019s workforce. Through the platform\u2019s direct access to top companies, consulting firms and independent workforce, we aim to support the shift towards life-long career development, transparency and flexibility.\r\nWelcome to our innovation for the future of work, our F ECTIVE workforce marketplace.", "short_description": "F ECTIVE is a workforce marketplace matching freelancer, consulting firm expertise and companies own employees to projects.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "2016-01-01", "num_employees_max": 10, "rank": 191746}, {"name": "ENIGMA SA", "num_employees_min": null, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/enigma-sa", "description": null, "short_description": "Switzerland's rising strategic & creative network they design transversal brand ecosystems for contemporary challenges.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": null, "num_employees_max": null, "rank": 249446}, {"name": "Biospectal", "num_employees_min": 1, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/biospectal", "description": "We're on a mission to reinvent medical sensing and monitoring through ubiquitous connected devices, IoT, and edge computing technologies.", "short_description": "We're on a mission to reinvent medical sensing and monitoring through ubiquitous connected devices, IoT, and edge computing technologies", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "2017-07-06", "num_employees_max": 10, "rank": 143463}, {"name": "Elqano - Where Knowledge Finds People", "num_employees_min": null, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/elqano-where-knowledge-finds-people", "description": "The story behind Elqano starts in a Coffee Conversation between two young professionals that wanted to shape the future of knowledge management.

Whilst complex and expensive multiple-use surgical instruments distinguished Swiss medical products in the past, today the market demands high-quality, economical, single-use instruments. Medicel offers a complete range of sterile packed intra-operative single-use instruments for cataract surgery which are in every way comparable to the exacting high standards of quality when compared to expensive multiple-use instruments. We do however also have multiple-use instruments as well as reusable instruments in our range. All products are compatible with most surgical equipment and facilitate traditional surgical techniques as well as the bimanual and coaxial techniques used in micro-incision surgery.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Medicel continues to transform market needs by developing innovative products that come with the most modern technology and will help surgeons to perform surgeries safer and more efficient.", "short_description": "Medicel AG is a leader in the design and manufacture of single-use injector devices for Intra Ocular Lenses.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "1996-01-01", "num_employees_max": 50, "rank": 359494}, {"name": "Melonport", "num_employees_min": 1, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/melonport", "description": "Melonport is the private company building the open-source Melon Protocol.

Their success is guaranteed by the quality of service and the relationship of confidence established with the policy-holder at each stage of the life of the contract. To maintain and develop this standard of quality, the employees and the partners of Evasan daily cultivate their team culture, which is characterized by: \r\n\r\nOpen spirit: Evasan permanently endeavours to carry out its customers\u2019 expectations, by developing the user-friendliness in transactions and providing personalized services for clients. \r\n\r\nTransparency: bearing in mind that each insurance policy is controlled by very precise and constraining rules, Evasan aims to achieve full comprehension of the benefits and limits subscribed by their international customers. \r\n\r\nCreativity: In the insurance world where originality is often quickly copied, the objective of Evasan is to remain at the point of progress and to share with its customers the last positive innovations in guaranteeing services. \r\n\r\nOn September 14, 1995, the Federal Department of Justice and Police authorized SOS EVASAN S.A. to provide special insurance, class No.18 \u201cAssistance\u201d (FOSC n\u00b05322-186), insuring the travellers according to the definition stated in the European classification of insurance risks. \r\n\r\nThe seat of the company was established in Geneva, Switzerland, a city highly symbolic for its humanitarian activities, its multicultural spirit and international nature. Initially, the activity of Evasan was focused on travellers coming from areas where the needs for assistance and insurance during displacement were traditionally present. Thus, its first markets were the European countries in transition and the Middle East states. \r\n\r\nThereafter, Evasan designed products intended specifically to fulfil the legal requirements of the Schengen area, which attracted new customers and provided a net competitive advantage. Evasan is now leader for Schengen visa travel insurance. \r\n\r\nBeing among the Swiss leaders of travel insurance and having a world network of agents and partners, Evasan nevertheless succeeded in keeping its humanitarian perspective. It enables Evasan to always remain in close touch with their customers and to provide them with services fully considering their specific needs. \r\n\r\nIn December 2004, in order to optimize its communication network, the head office of Evasan was moved to Vich, between Lausanne and Geneva, on the shores of Lake Geneva. \r\n\r\nToday, more than one million people are covered by Evasan\u2019s travel insurance and assistance during their trips to the four corners of the world.", "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/sos-evasan-s-a", "num_employees_min": 11, "short_description": "SOS Evasan S A (\u201cEvasan\u201d) is a leading Swiss-based travel insurance and assistance company.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "1995-09-14", "num_employees_max": 50, "rank": 142273}, {"name": "Bluewave Studio", "description": "Bluewave Studio (S\u00e0rl) is a communication agency specialized in custom-made web, mobile, and design solutions.

Relying on shoe sizing information provided online does not make it any easier because of the shoe sizing chaos everyone is familiar with: Sizing systems differ from country to country (US, UK, EU, IT etc.), between and within brands. \r\n\r\nOnly 5% of all shoes purchased are ordered online. The main reason for people not to buy shoes online is their insecurity about the right size. Moreover, when people order shoes online, 50% of the purchases are returned mainly due to a bad fit.\r\n\r\nShoeSize.Me came up with a solution to accurately recommend the right shoe size to an online shoe shopper. The ShoeSize.Me plug-in can be directly and seamlessly integrated on the product detail page of any online shop and allows the user to get size recommendations with only a few clicks.  The user is asked to mention the size of a shoe model that fits him well. By referring to the ShoeSize.Me algorithm, the accurate size for the user is immediately generated, which (s)he can then take into account for when selecting his size. \r\n\r\nThe ShoeSize.Me solution benefits both consumers and online retailers. With the accurate shoe size recommendation, the purchase of multiple shoes sizes as well as the returns of ill-fitting shoes dramatically decreases.

Changes to a BOM can happen at various stages throughout the lifecycle of a product, often without changing original hardware design data, such as schematics or layout. For many companies, this can involve an error prone manual change to a spreadsheet or document, with no record of who made the changes, when they were made or why they were made.\r\n\r\nCiiva provides a fully traceable, version controlled BOM management feature, where every component used in a BOM is linked to an access controlled, centralized component library.", "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/ciiva", "num_employees_min": 11, "short_description": "Ciiva develops and offers cloud based bill of materials and electronic parts management software.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "2012-05-01", "num_employees_max": 50, "rank": 131695}, {"name": "AGT International", "description": "Founded in 2007, by CEO Mati Kochavi, AGT International is a privately held technology company with over $1B in annual revenue.

Authors must be granted their fair reward while users must be effectively involved. That\u2019s why Etalia has been built upon an effective and original business model, patented in US. \r\nIn Etalia, authors are free to create, aggregate and distribute personal content as well as advanced multi-page newspapers in an ecosystem which respects their copyright, ensuring them the largest revenue share. Users can assemble personalized newspapers, filtering and sorting best fitting contents from all different sources with truly unparalleled freedom; they can choose among suggested topics, pages and journals, or they can individually set the filters of their own press reviews. Above all, they are encouraged to aggregate and redistribute third-party contents in a personal newspaper: they will share revenues with authors in a realtime process.\r\nWith an open proprietary platform to sell advertising, taking advantage of complete profiling of both users and content, Etalia can monetize adverts better than any competitor: we know who\u2019s reading what, every time, everywhere.\r\nBut there\u2019s not only advertising: Etalia supports sales too. Authors and users can distribute journals or individual content as premium, deciding the price and subscription policies, always being granted the largest revenue share.\r\nFar from a common news or feed aggregator, Etalia offers a powerful technology viable for companies and firms willing to distribute proprietary contents: a marketing sector which is growing more and more meaningful when typical banners and online campaigns are proved to be every day less effective.\r\nThus, Etalia is far more than an effective technology, though superior than anyone else\u2019s: in Etalia the technology grows over the solid foundations of a strong and original business model.

This medical laser is a great help and successful treatment against Tinntius and other inner ear deseases. The extraordinary thing is that this equipment can be applied from any person without knowledge. Under medical supervision and costsharing of health insurance companies did we made our first successful laser therapy in 1994.

How do I find out what treatment and what aid is right for me? Whoever suffers from tinnitus often loses the zest for life and hope for recovery. This does not have to be! \r\n Our goal is to give you the best possible overview of the treatment possibilities for tinnitus and for similar inner ear disorders, such as partial deafness due to tinnitus, ear pressure, dizziness (morbus M\u00e9ni\u00e8re, vertigo), acute hearing loss and hearing distortion. In collaboration with affected persons and with specialists we are researching and developing new forms of therapy and evaluating their chances of success. \r\nResults from a new study show that almost a quarter of the population has already experienced a \"ringing in the ears\" at one time or other. Almost 10% hear these sounds in their ears uninterruptedly for five minutes or longer. With 3% one can speak of chronic tinnitus. The earlier treatment begins, the greater the chances of a successful cure. \r\nThe most important and encouraging information is the fact that tinnitus has a benign cause in 99% of all cases. It can be regarded as a natural risk of modern living and a part of the aging process. In order to be certain about even the last percent, one should go to an ear, nose and throat specialist. If the diagnosis is benign then, medication or surgical treaments will have scarcely any effect here. Do not lose hope, however. We will try to advise you objectively and to inform you about the most promising of the treatment possibilities. \r\nThe EarNoiseEliminator can be used for the following applications: \r\n\u2022 Ear pressure: \t1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least   6 weeks \r\n\u2022 Acute hearing loss/hearing distortion: \t1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 12 weeks \r\n\u2022 Dizziness:\t1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least   8 weeks \r\n\u2022 Partial deafness due to tinnitus:\t1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 12  weeks \r\n\u2022 Tinnitus:\t1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 12 - 52 weeks \r\nThe following link shows how the EarNoiseEliminator is working :\r\nhttp://www.earnoiseeliminator.com/index.php?lang=en&inc=19\r\nThat link brings you to our Webshop :\r\nhttp://www.earnoiseeliminator.com/index.php?lang=en&inc=99\r\nAlso you get for free our Guide for the application of EarNoiseEliminator in addition to the\r\ntherapies for sudden deafness - tinnitus - hearing loss - dizziness (vertigo) and pressure in \r\nthe ear. \r\nContact: \r\nDDRUM AG\r\nPOBox\r\nRiedstrasse 6\r\nCH-8953 Dietikon\r\nTel:  +41 (0) 447 422 600 \r\nFax: +41 (0) 447 422 601 \r\ninfo@earnoiseeliminator.com \r\nhttp://www.earnoiseeliminator.com/index.php?lang=en&inc=19\r\ntinitus video von myvideo\r\nhttp://www.myvideo.ch/watch/8054424", "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/ddrum-ag", "num_employees_min": 1, "short_description": "The company ddrum was founded in 1985 with the function of a general importer for brands like: ddrum, Ludwig, Nordlead, Nord Modular,", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "1983-06-01", "num_employees_max": 10, "rank": 343774}, {"name": "Gene Signal", "description": "Gene Signal is a research and development based biotechnology company focused on discovering genes involved in the regulation of angiogenesis.\n\nGene Signal's ophthalmic research program is pioneering targeted upstream blockade of pathological angiogenesis through the inhibition \u0003of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1)", "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/gene-signal", "num_employees_min": 11, "short_description": "Gene Signal is a research and development based biotechnology company focused on discovering genes.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "founded_on": "2000-01-01", "num_employees_max": 50, "rank": 371720}, {"name": "Intacapital Swiss", "description": "IntaCapital Swiss is a modern and dynamic boutique finance company of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWe represent the traditional Swiss Banking practices of discretion, strength, reliability and performance.

This enables users to tag the hotels they are interested in while browsing and come back to them all later.  Travelers can gain an overview and insight into destinations including information on; Trip Preparation, Country & People, Discover & Enjoy and Getting Around. \r\n\r\nBefore travelers book their hotel they will probably want to know what is on offer in the local area and what it is like. Things to do cover sightseeing, Sport & Leisure, Food & Drinks, Nightlife, Shopping and other tips from travelers in the Things to do reviews.  Travelers can find the best price by comparing offers from various providers on HolidayCheck with just one click. The newsletter each month presents subscribers with a brand new destination. It provide quality travel information and genuine user pictures to give an authentic insight into the destination. \r\n\r\nThe HolidayCheck idea dates back to 1999 when two guys Markus Schott and Sascha Vasic, frustrated with the lack of authentic information when choosing a hotel, decided to create a website which would give others the opportunity to read real opinions and reviews instead of just catalogue descriptions. They created the first HolidayCheck website as a hobby. In 2004 HolidayCheck was founded as a company in Switzerland. After that HolidayCheck grew even faster and started its first international websites in 2006: www.holidaycheck.com and www.holidaycheck.fr closely followed by Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian and Dutch in 2007. Today HolidayCheck is available in 10 languages. \r\n\r\nEach month 20 - 30 million people visit HolidayCheck websites. On HolidayCheck users inform themselves about hotels and destinations with about 10 million user opinions. Information is available on more than 300 thousand hotels and 100 thousand points of interest in the holiday destinations. \r\n\r\nHolidayCheck AG headquarters are located in Bottighofen, Switzerland and has three foreign offices in Warsaw, Paris and Moskow. The majority of HolidayCheck is owned by the listed company TOMORROW FOCUS AG, one of the leading digital media companies in Germany.

Everyone should be able to benefit from JANZZ.technology, not only in Switzerland, but worldwide.\n\nJANZZ.technology launched its first product at the end of 2010: JANZZ.jobs, an innovative employment matching platform designed to reinvigorate labor and job markets, considerably improve on the systems previously used in portals of this kind, and optimize the operations of public employment services.

This innovation resolved a number of well-known problems associated with existing cutting technologies in industrial applications. Consequently, Synova was founded by Richerzhagen in 1997 in Lausanne to make the patented Laser MicroJet (LMJ) technology available to high-tech industrial manufacturers.\n\nSince 1998, various industries worldwide have switched to this laser process for their production needs. In addition, the particular advantages have led to a number of new applications such as in the domain of sensitive material processing where Synova was the first company to introduce the laser into semiconductor wafer dicing in 2001.\n\nSince 2003, the company established wholly owned local subsidiaries in the USA, Japan, India and Korea for optimized customer support. These have since been expanded to include micro-machining centers (MMCs) with Taiwan and China planned for the future.\n\nSYNOVA presently has 75 employees including 35 engineers focused primarily on researching new material  cutting solutions, further applications and laser cutting equipment. Aside from research, both the final assembly and testing of up to 100 machines a year are performed in Synova\u2019s modern, 1800 square meter facility in Duillier.\n\nIn 2010 Synova successfully entered the gem diamond cutting business.  Subsequently, the company was strategically re-organized according to market segments forming three distinct business units:  Diamonds, Semiconductors and Metal Industry.\n\nSYNOVA has established several partnerships with leading industrial machine manufacturers for the production of LMJ machines, most recently with Makino. The company also cooperates with respected research institutions, universities and industry players on strategic projects to further develop and exploit the technology, including the Fraunhofer ILT and IPT, EMPA and Carl Zeiss Jena.\n\nSYNOVA is now a company with global reach focused on delivering highest-quality solutions and services to its customers wherever they are.
