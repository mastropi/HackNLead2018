The short-term consequences can be felt at a personal level impacting directly on comfort and security. An uprooting, or a profound change of environment, is sometimes considered as necessary. Elderly people are particularly sensitive to the stability of their environment and a profound change is often experienced as a form of trauma.\n\nThe recent technological developments give them access to tools that allow them to maintain a benevolent and discrete presence, at a distance from their home, from their family or institutions.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nThe AutonomisHome Foundation seeks to reinforce the autonomy of elderly people struggling to maintain their quality of life and that through the counsel and/or the financing of technical solutions.\n\nOUR GOAL\n\nFirst of all, the AutonomisHome Foundation offers advice on the most pertinent technical solutions proposed for promoting the reinforcement of autonomy at home. The issues that elderly people faces such as handicap, pathologies, mobility, etc in relation to their home must be considered in order to find the best solution. The impact of these solutions in terms of change is evaluated regarding the reinforcement of autonomy and the expected improvement of both their comfort and their security. Moreover, the respect of their private life and privacy must be preserved through technological choices that are the least invasive.\n\nThe costs of this solution are evaluated and the AutonomisHome Foundation can, on request of an accredited organism, offer a partial or complete fund for this solution.\n\nThe Foundation delivers a label that certifies not only the accreditation, but also the guarantee that the setting up of the autonomy supporting system and, especially its integration in a program of home care, will be truly efficient.
