Evasan is licensed under Class 18 of the European and Swiss insurances classification and regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA. \r\n\r\nEvasan provides primarily medical and emergency assistance. Their success is guaranteed by the quality of service and the relationship of confidence established with the policy-holder at each stage of the life of the contract. To maintain and develop this standard of quality, the employees and the partners of Evasan daily cultivate their team culture, which is characterized by: \r\n\r\nOpen spirit: Evasan permanently endeavours to carry out its customers\u2019 expectations, by developing the user-friendliness in transactions and providing personalized services for clients. \r\n\r\nTransparency: bearing in mind that each insurance policy is controlled by very precise and constraining rules, Evasan aims to achieve full comprehension of the benefits and limits subscribed by their international customers. \r\n\r\nCreativity: In the insurance world where originality is often quickly copied, the objective of Evasan is to remain at the point of progress and to share with its customers the last positive innovations in guaranteeing services. \r\n\r\nOn September 14, 1995, the Federal Department of Justice and Police authorized SOS EVASAN S.A. to provide special insurance, class No.18 \u201cAssistance\u201d (FOSC n\u00b05322-186), insuring the travellers according to the definition stated in the European classification of insurance risks. \r\n\r\nThe seat of the company was established in Geneva, Switzerland, a city highly symbolic for its humanitarian activities, its multicultural spirit and international nature. Initially, the activity of Evasan was focused on travellers coming from areas where the needs for assistance and insurance during displacement were traditionally present. Thus, its first markets were the European countries in transition and the Middle East states. \r\n\r\nThereafter, Evasan designed products intended specifically to fulfil the legal requirements of the Schengen area, which attracted new customers and provided a net competitive advantage. Evasan is now leader for Schengen visa travel insurance. \r\n\r\nBeing among the Swiss leaders of travel insurance and having a world network of agents and partners, Evasan nevertheless succeeded in keeping its humanitarian perspective. It enables Evasan to always remain in close touch with their customers and to provide them with services fully considering their specific needs. \r\n\r\nIn December 2004, in order to optimize its communication network, the head office of Evasan was moved to Vich, between Lausanne and Geneva, on the shores of Lake Geneva. \r\n\r\nToday, more than one million people are covered by Evasan\u2019s travel insurance and assistance during their trips to the four corners of the world."}, {"num_employees_max": 10, "num_employees_min": 1, "rank": 310788, "short_description": "Bluewave Studio is a digital design company which provides web, mobile, and UX / UI design solutions.", "total_funding_usd": 0, "url": "https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/organizations/bluewave-s\u00e0rl", "name": "Bluewave Studio", "founded_on": "1998-12-22", "description": "Bluewave Studio (S\u00e0rl) is a communication agency specialized in custom-made web, mobile, and design solutions.
