The main reason for people not to buy shoes online is their insecurity about the right size. Moreover, when people order shoes online, 50% of the purchases are returned mainly due to a bad fit.\r\n\r\nShoeSize.Me came up with a solution to accurately recommend the right shoe size to an online shoe shopper. The ShoeSize.Me plug-in can be directly and seamlessly integrated on the product detail page of any online shop and allows the user to get size recommendations with only a few clicks.  The user is asked to mention the size of a shoe model that fits him well. By referring to the ShoeSize.Me algorithm, the accurate size for the user is immediately generated, which (s)he can then take into account for when selecting his size. \r\n\r\nThe ShoeSize.Me solution benefits both consumers and online retailers. With the accurate shoe size recommendation, the purchase of multiple shoes sizes as well as the returns of ill-fitting shoes dramatically decreases.

Authors must be granted their fair reward while users must be effectively involved. That\u2019s why Etalia has been built upon an effective and original business model, patented in US. \r\nIn Etalia, authors are free to create, aggregate and distribute personal content as well as advanced multi-page newspapers in an ecosystem which respects their copyright, ensuring them the largest revenue share. Users can assemble personalized newspapers, filtering and sorting best fitting contents from all different sources with truly unparalleled freedom; they can choose among suggested topics, pages and journals, or they can individually set the filters of their own press reviews. Above all, they are encouraged to aggregate and redistribute third-party contents in a personal newspaper: they will share revenues with authors in a realtime process.\r\nWith an open proprietary platform to sell advertising, taking advantage of complete profiling of both users and content, Etalia can monetize adverts better than any competitor: we know who\u2019s reading what, every time, everywhere.\r\nBut there\u2019s not only advertising: Etalia supports sales too.

This medical laser is a great help and successful treatment against Tinntius and other inner ear deseases. The extraordinary thing is that this equipment can be applied from any person without knowledge. Under medical supervision and costsharing of health insurance companies did we made our first successful laser therapy in 1994. All the other developments and studies make it possible now, that we can offer this help by the laser therapy against tinnitus for a successful treatment at home.\r\n\r\nEarNoiseEliminator against Tinnitus - what should you do when it whistles, rings, roars or drones in your ear ?\r\nNo one tinnitus is the same as another. How do I find out what treatment and what aid is right for me? Whoever suffers from tinnitus often loses the zest for life and hope for recovery. This does not have to be! \r\n Our goal is to give you the best possible overview of the treatment possibilities for tinnitus and for similar inner ear disorders, such as partial deafness due to tinnitus, ear pressure, dizziness (morbus M\u00e9ni\u00e8re, vertigo), acute hearing loss and hearing distortion. In collaboration with affected persons and with specialists we are researching and developing new forms of therapy and evaluating their chances of success. \r\nResults from a new study show that almost a quarter of the population has already experienced a \"ringing in the ears\" at one time or other. Almost 10% hear these sounds in their ears uninterruptedly for five minutes or longer. With 3% one can speak of chronic tinnitus. The earlier treatment begins, the greater the chances of a successful cure. \r\nThe most important and encouraging information is the fact that tinnitus has a benign cause in 99% of all cases.

This enables users to tag the hotels they are interested in while browsing and come back to them all later.  Travelers can gain an overview and insight into destinations including information on; Trip Preparation, Country & People, Discover & Enjoy and Getting Around. \r\n\r\nBefore travelers book their hotel they will probably want to know what is on offer in the local area and what it is like. Things to do cover sightseeing, Sport & Leisure, Food & Drinks, Nightlife, Shopping and other tips from travelers in the Things to do reviews.  Travelers can find the best price by comparing offers from various providers on HolidayCheck with just one click. The newsletter each month presents subscribers with a brand new destination. It provide quality travel information and genuine user pictures to give an authentic insight into the destination. \r\n\r\nThe HolidayCheck idea dates back to 1999 when two guys Markus Schott and Sascha Vasic, frustrated with the lack of authentic information when choosing a hotel, decided to create a website which would give others the opportunity to read real opinions and reviews instead of just catalogue descriptions. They created the first HolidayCheck website as a hobby. In 2004 HolidayCheck was founded as a company in Switzerland. After that HolidayCheck grew even faster and started its first international websites in 2006: www.holidaycheck.com and www.holidaycheck.fr closely followed by Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian and Dutch in 2007. Today HolidayCheck is available in 10 languages. \r\n\r\nEach month 20 - 30 million people visit HolidayCheck websites. On HolidayCheck users inform themselves about hotels and destinations with about 10 million user opinions. Information is available on more than 300 thousand hotels and 100 thousand points of interest in the holiday destinations. \r\n\r\nHolidayCheck AG headquarters are located in Bottighofen, Switzerland and has three foreign offices in Warsaw, Paris and Moskow.

Everyone should be able to benefit from JANZZ.technology, not only in Switzerland, but worldwide.\n\nJANZZ.technology launched its first product at the end of 2010: JANZZ.jobs, an innovative employment matching platform designed to reinvigorate labor and job markets, considerably improve on the systems previously used in portals of this kind, and optimize the operations of public employment services.

Prior to founding Oncoethix and assuming responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Noel had co-founded another oncology drug development company which in-licensed oxaliplatin as its first portfolio product and subsequently identified, evaluated, and in-licensed novel agents for several clients.

This innovation resolved a number of well-known problems associated with existing cutting technologies in industrial applications. Consequently, Synova was founded by Richerzhagen in 1997 in Lausanne to make the patented Laser MicroJet (LMJ) technology available to high-tech industrial manufacturers.\n\nSince 1998, various industries worldwide have switched to this laser process for their production needs. In addition, the particular advantages have led to a number of new applications such as in the domain of sensitive material processing where Synova was the first company to introduce the laser into semiconductor wafer dicing in 2001.\n\nSince 2003, the company established wholly owned local subsidiaries in the USA, Japan, India and Korea for optimized customer support. These have since been expanded to include micro-machining centers (MMCs) with Taiwan and China planned for the future.\n\nSYNOVA presently has 75 employees including 35 engineers focused primarily on researching new material  cutting solutions, further applications and laser cutting equipment. Aside from research, both the final assembly and testing of up to 100 machines a year are performed in Synova\u2019s modern, 1800 square meter facility in Duillier.\n\nIn 2010 Synova successfully entered the gem diamond cutting business.  Subsequently, the company was strategically re-organized according to market segments forming three distinct business units:  Diamonds, Semiconductors and Metal Industry.\n\nSYNOVA has established several partnerships with leading industrial machine manufacturers for the production of LMJ machines, most recently with Makino. The company also cooperates with respected research institutions, universities and industry players on strategic projects to further develop and exploit the technology, including the Fraunhofer ILT and IPT, EMPA and Carl Zeiss Jena.\n\nSYNOVA is now a company with global reach focused on delivering highest-quality solutions and services to its customers wherever they are.
