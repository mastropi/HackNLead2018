Goal: Cluster the startup companies into a few categories (clusters) based on their description.
Description: An SVD is run on the TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) matrix constructed on the Description field of the 667 companies in the 'startup.ch 2013 - 2018' dataset. A K-means cluster algorithm is run on the top singular vectors (typically 3) classifying the companies into e.g. 5 clusters.
