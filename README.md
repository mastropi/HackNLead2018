# HackNLead2018
Hack And Lead 2018 Hackaton in Zurich

## Repository organization

There should be one folder for each challenge as long as we are participating in that challenge.

Since we have chosen to work on the Swisscom challenge there is at least the swisscom directory where we should do our work for that challenge. We may end up having this single directory as a "challenge" directory, but just in case we decide to switch to another challenge during the Hackaton, we are allowing for that possibility.

The swisscom directory is organized as follows:  
- code  	--> files with code (such as Python notebooks, R projects, etc.)  
- data  	--> data sets we work on (e.g. provided by Swisscom, some other that we download, etc.)  
- docs 		--> supporting documentation (such as papers), our own documentation (such as the pitch), etc.  
- results 	--> result files worth saving such as graphs, Excel files, etc., that we could potentially use for the pitch/presentation.  

IMPORTANT: If a particular data set is too "large" (say > 5 MB) in the data directory we may not want to track it... (but share it in e.g. Google Drive)... as otherwise it may slow down the version control process...
